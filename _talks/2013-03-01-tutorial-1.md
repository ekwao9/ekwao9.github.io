As the Master of Ceremony for this event, I capitalized on this opportunity to bring to the minds of parents, what it means to invest in their wards' education and why being involved in the their wards' lives goes a long way to help their outputs and that of society at large. I also highlighted the in-built reciprocity that exists between teachers and parents when it comes to raising students in the right direction. [Picture from the event](/images/MC.jpg).
