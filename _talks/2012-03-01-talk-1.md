In this talk, I shared my experience as a graduate student, the opportunities surrounding Master's and PhD holders and why industries in recent times seek the expertise of PhD holders. I also used this opportunity to advise undergraduate students, who are yet to make decisions with regards to their careers to get as much information as possible, as the bridge between where we are and where we want to find ourselves is information.
