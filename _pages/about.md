Born in Accra, Ghana, I received my bachelor’s degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the reputable [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/) (KNUST),Ghana-West Africa, in August 2020. In KNUST, I cultivated the habit of self-studying and the ability to independently find information to solve problems. As a member of the [Antenna Group KNUST](https://antennagroupknust.com/), I led a team of three to design "HIGH GAIN PRINTED LOG-PERIODIC DIPOLE
ANTENNA FOR 440 – 690 MHz UHF APPLICATIONS" for my final year thesis.

I am currently a master's research student at the [Intelligent Communication and Information Security](https://sites.google.com/view/hbnu-icis/home?authuser=0) (ICIS) Lab, Department of Information and Communication Engineering at the [Hanbat National University](https://www.hanbat.ac.kr/eng/) (HBNU), Daejeon-South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Inkyu Bang and co-supervised by Prof. Taehoon Kim. 

Research Interest
======
Although I have not fully developed my research area, I am generally interested in:
* Wireless Network Security
* Random Access
* Application of Deep/Machine Learning in Wireless Communincation
* Convex Optimization in Wireless Communication Systems


Getting started
======
1. Register a GitHub account if you don't have one and confirm your e-mail (required!)
1. Fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) by clicking the "fork" button in the top right. 
1. Go to the repository's settings (rightmost item in the tabs that start with "Code", should be below "Unwatch"). Rename the repository "[your GitHub username].github.io", which will also be your website's URL.
1. Set site-wide configuration and create content & metadata (see below -- also see [this set of diffs](http://archive.is/3TPas) showing what files were changed to set up [an example site](https://getorg-testacct.github.io) for a user with the username "getorg-testacct")
1. Upload any files (like PDFs, .zip files, etc.) to the files/ directory. They will appear at https://[your GitHub username].github.io/files/example.pdf.  
1. Check status by going to the repository settings, in the "GitHub pages" section
