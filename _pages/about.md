Born in Accra, Ghana, I received my bachelor’s degree in Telecommunication Engineering from the reputable [Kwame Nkrumah University of Science and Technology](https://www.knust.edu.gh/) (KNUST),Ghana-West Africa, in August 2020. In KNUST, I cultivated the habit of self-studying and the ability to independently find information to solve problems. As a member of the [Antenna Group KNUST](https://antennagroupknust.com/), I led a team of three to design "HIGH GAIN PRINTED LOG-PERIODIC DIPOLE
ANTENNA FOR 440 – 690 MHz UHF APPLICATIONS" for my final year thesis.

I am currently a master's research student at the [Intelligent Communication and Information Security](https://sites.google.com/view/hbnu-icis/home?authuser=0) (ICIS) Lab, Department of Intelligence Media Engineering at the [Hanbat National University](https://www.hanbat.ac.kr/eng/) (HBNU), Daejeon-South Korea, under the supervision of Prof. Inkyu Bang and co-supervised by Prof. Taehoon Kim. 

Research Interest
======
Although I have not fully developed my research area, I am generally interested in:
* Wireless Network Security.
* Random Access.
* Information Theory.
* Application of Deep/Machine Learning in Wireless Communication Systems
* Optimization in Wireless Communication Systems.
* Cellular Communication Networks (4G LTE, 5G).
* Internet of Things (IoT).



Favourite Quotes
======
Over the years, I have tried to model my life on these quotes:
* "We cannot solve our problems with the same thinking we used when we created them."- Albert Einstein
* “If I had five minutes to chop down a tree, I’d spend the first three sharpening my axe.”-Abraham Lincoln
* “Nobody is going to pour truth into your brain. It’s something you have to find out for yourself.”-Noam Chomsky
* "Learn continually - there is always 'one more thing' to learn!" - Steve Jobs


Recent News
