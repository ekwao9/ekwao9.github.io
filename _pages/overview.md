## Overview

Some of the technical courses I have enrolled in: 
* Linear Algebra.
* Convex Optimization: HBNU (Taught by [Prof. Inkyu Bang](https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&as_sdt=0%2C5&q=inkyu+bang&btnG=)).
* Probability, Statistics and Random Processes: HBNU (Taught by Prof. Inkyu Bang).
* Signal Processing for Vehicular Communication.
* Information Theory: HBNU (Taught by Prof. Inkyu Bang).
* Deep Learning Specialization: Coursera (Taught by Andrew Ng).
* MIT6.0002 - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science (Taught by John Guttag and Eric Grimson).


### Projects
As part of my master's degree, I am currently working on vulnerabilities associated with uplink synchronization
in practical 4G LTE and 5G cellular networks using Universal Software Radio Peripherals(USRPs) with commercial antennas, srsRAN's open-source library for LTE protocols,
high specification linux distributed(ubuntu) PCs, mobile phones and wireshark.

Prior to this (_first year second semester of my master's studies_), we(my supervisors and I) submitted summary of a novel research 
problem we seek to solve in deep learning based multiuser communication systems to [Korea Institute of Communication Sciences](https://www.dbpia.co.kr/Journal/articleDetail?nodeId=NODE11108055), and presented the research idea in a [poster presentation](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KtfG6gW4x_plSe6Mz5aXzjiXlQopCGrT/view). In this work, a well designed adversarial perturbation 
is transmitted by a malicious user alongside its original signal. This perturbation has a discriminatory effect of degrading the
transmitted signal of normal users while rendering the malicious user's own signal immune to this effect.
