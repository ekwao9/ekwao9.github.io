## Overview

Some of the technical courses I have enrolled in: 
* Linear Algebra
* Probability and Statistics 
* Signal Processing for Wireless Communication
* Information Theory
* Convex Optimization (current class)
* Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Bayesian Learning: Udemy
* MIT6.0002 - Introduction to Computational Thinking and Data Science

As part of my master's degree, I am currently working on vulnerability analysis in mutiuser mimo networks. Prior to this (during 1st year master's), 
I worked in the domain of deep learning and physical layer security. Deep learning has exhibited great potential in communication systems. Recent advances 
in deep learning based physical layer techniques have shown that the communication system can be modeled as an end-to-end learning task. I implemented 
end-to-end learning approach for physical layer security in Gaussian Multiple Access Wiretap Channel. I designed a loss function based on coset 
coding(traditional wiretap coding technique) and a modified kmeans algorithm. This loss function had controllable parameters that can be tuned to guarantee 
reliability, secrecy and user-priority. In addition to this, I designed training steps that was used on our deep learning model to guarantee model efficiency.
